# Autocopy

## Aim
Copying files regularly from A to B using a scheduled windows executable.

## Summary
This small collection allows to create a small .exe which can be scheduled to
regularly copy files from A to B

## Settings:
In order to run the script [autocopy.py][1] please install python (preferentially with conda).
Further you need to provide the [autocopy_settings.json][2] file which contains the
necessary source and destination file paths.

.... How to schedule Tasks on Windows will be written soon ...
